A Chess "AI" based on the MiniMax algorithm. 

Play against the AI and hope you don't lose. If you want to make it easier or more difficult,
you can change the difficulty at "Game.h" line 33.

Originally written with SDL3, but found that raylib is easier to download and run.
Should just be able to build with cmake and run the executable. (Only tested with MinGW GCC)
